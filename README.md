# ohjelmoinnin-perusteet-s2021
This repo contains assignments from the "Introduction to Programming" course from fall 2021.
The course was conducted in finnish thus most of the code is in finnish.

Weekly assignments were trivial for the first few weeks, so they weren't saved.
All 3 levels of practical assignment, their respective task descriptions and relevant files can be found under the **Harkka/** folder.

## Harkka/The Better Minimi
The "improved" minimum-requirement practical assignment.
Changed the size of data table to be dynamic, allowing for X weeks of Y exercises instead of the practical limit 14 x 5.
Removed old redundant comments explaining old data structure.
